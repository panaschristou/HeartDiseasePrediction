# HeartDiseasePrediction
Predicting Heart Disease using ANN for the Cleveland dataset (downloaded from kaggle)
Dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
Dataset contains 14 variables out of which the target variable is the depended variable and the variable which denotes whether or not the patient has a heart disease
The aim was to do exploratory data analysis first to inspect the data and fill any missing values
Then perform preprocessing on the data to get better accuracy and reliable results
Then created an ANN with 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer (tried 2 hidden layers but accuracy dropped)
Predicted the results and produced the confusion matrix
